<h1>Yanan's Portfolio</h1>
This is my portfolio project for Udacity's Front End Nano Degree. It is responsive and suitable to view on Google Nexus 5, Ipad and Desktop.
It has passed W3C's HTML and CSS validator. Used <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>media query</strong> to make it responsive.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

To run the project, click on the `index.html`, it will run in your default browser.

## HowToPlay

1 randomly click on cards, if the icons match, the 2 cards will stay open.

2 the timer, moves counter and stars are all ways to measure your performance.

3 you can reset the game any time by clicking on the restart icon.

4 when you have matched all the cards, a modal will pop up, showing your performance rating.

5 you can simply close the pop up modal, or start one more game by clicking on the `start new game` button on the modal.

## Dependencies

1 **Bootstrap** cdn is used for page layout design and is included in `index.html`.
2 **JQuery** cdn is used for performing functionalities and is included in `index.html` as well.

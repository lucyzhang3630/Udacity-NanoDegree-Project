## Instructions

This is a classic Arcade Game, written by `html`, `css` and `js`.
The main purpose is to make the player(the boy) to go arcoss the the brick blocks to the water, in the mean time avoid the collision with the enemies (the bugs).

The enemies have different moving speed, be careful when moving the player :)
Any collision with the enemy will result in the failure of the game and send the player to the beginning position.
If the player reached the river successfully, the player wins and will go to the beginning position, so that you can play again :)
